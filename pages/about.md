# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

A first year Computer Science student studying at the University of Birmingham. I'm currently <strong>Socials Rep</strong> for the University's Computer Science Society (<strong>CSS</strong>) as a part of the <strong>2020/21</strong> committee. My passions include programming (and maintaining my projects), attending hackathons, and listening to various genres of music from indie and rap to hip hop.
