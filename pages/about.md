# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

A first year Computer Science student studying at the University of Birmingham. I'm currently <strong>Socials Rep</strong> for the University's Computer Science Society (<strong>CSS</strong>) as a part of the <strong>2020/21</strong> committee. I'm also the <strong>Undergraduate Computer Science School Rep</strong> for the 2020/21 academic year, and so if you have any questions about or feedback for the School, please get in touch with me!<br>

My passions include programming (and maintaining my projects), attending hackathons, and listening to various genres of music from indie and rap to hip hop.<br>

I'm currently learning React.js, FastAPI and Docker! (as well as playing with Google Cloud stuff, amongst other things)
