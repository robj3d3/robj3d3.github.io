# WhatTheCTF? 2020

WhatTheCTF? 2020 is the second CTF event ran by AFNOM, the University of Birmingham's hacking club - which I regularly attend meetings for.

With this being the second CTF I've taken part in, our team of 3 achieved 5th place out of a total of 13 teams. Out of the 13 challenges we managed to solve in the allotted time, I solved 8.
