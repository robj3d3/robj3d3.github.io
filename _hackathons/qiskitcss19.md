# CSS Qiskit Hackathon 2019

The CSS Qiskit Hackathon, organised by IBM Quantum Experience in conjunction with the University of Birmingham's Computer Science Society (CSS), involved two preliminary workshops covering the basics of quantum computing theory and how to use IBM's Qiskit framework.

We were then challenged to apply what we'd learned to create something interesting using the Qiskit framework.

Our team took advantage of the true randomness attribute of quantum computing to create a casino based on quantum-randomness (all fun and games).
