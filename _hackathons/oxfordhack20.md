# Oxford Hack 2020

Oxford Hack 2020 was the first digital event organised by Oxford Hack, and also the first ever digithon that I had participated in.

Our team developed a catching, isolation-inspired videogame made in Python using the Pygame libraries. The objective for our project was to create a game that functioned not only as a form of entertainment for those isolated, but also as a practical tool to train young children to be aware of how to protect themselves in such drastic times.

With the digithon being held online, our team (consisting of three friends living in different countries) had to take full advantage of using continuous integration with Git. It was my first real experience communicating and collaborating as a team online in such a way, and overall I'm proud of what we achieved.
