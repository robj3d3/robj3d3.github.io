# LAN Parties

LAN parties are a great event for everyone! Commuter, non-commuter? It doesn't matter! We'll make sure to organise some of these parties at the weekend during the day, as well as at night (especially if they get popular), so that everyone can join in!

Not familiar with LAN parties? They're where we all get together on computers in the same room (in the CS building), relax and play video games. Games I have in mind for this event are Super Smash Bros, Minecraft, Call of Duty and plenty others!

Got an idea for a game you want to play? No problem, as your Socials Rep I'll make sure your voice is heard! Just shoot me a message via any of my social medias.
