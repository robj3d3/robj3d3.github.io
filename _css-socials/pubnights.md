# Pub Nights

Pub nights are where you and your friends can get together to enjoy a drink (or two.. or three.. or... more) and hang out at the end of the week! Forget about all of your work, and just enjoy socialising with your friends, as well as meeting new ones!

There will be plenty of these nights organised throughout the year with me as your Socials Rep.

The pubs we'll visit include The S'Oak, The Goose and The Bristol Pear but I'll always be on the look out for new venues too!
