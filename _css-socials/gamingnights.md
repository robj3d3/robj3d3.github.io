# Online Gaming Nights

Given the current social distancing situation, one guaranteed way I know to bring us back together as a society is through online gaming nights! A night where you can hop onto your computer (or even just your phone for some of the games!), chill and reconnect with all your friends from across the society.

Games I had in mind include Minecraft, Jackbox Games, Skribbl.io and Cards Against Humanity, just to name a few! I'm also really looking forward to seeing all of your suggestions for games too!

With all this time on our hands, there isn't much reason why we shouldn't have several of these nights!
