# Workshops & Talks

As your Socials Rep I'll be sure to keep workshops and talks a regular in the calendar! Whether these are tech workshops like the ones run about Git and Docker earlier this year, or just interesting and fun talks from people within and outside the committee, I'll be at the head of putting them together!

Got a workshop idea? Want to run a talk? I'm easily contactable via any of my social media, just shoot me a message and we can sort it out!
