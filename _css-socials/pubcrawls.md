# Pub Crawls

Similar to a pub nights, but BETTER! A pub crawl is where you'll spend the night going across Selly and Birmingham visiting plenty of different pubs and bars as a group with your friends, drinking lots and all for low prices!

At a pub crawl you can really let your hair down and have fun. Just don't forget to take pictures, it's a night you won't want to forget ;)
