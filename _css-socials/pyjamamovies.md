# Pyjama Movie Nights

A slightly newer idea, pyjama movie nights would involve everyone coming into The Sloman Lounge late in the evening (but not too late, don't worry!) dressed in their best pyjamas to enjoy free snacks, watch a movie and hang out with friends!

A great way to de-stress after a busy day or just an event to chill out at and have fun.

Got movie suggestions? Hit me with them! I'm all ears!
