# Phishing Project

This open-source tool was developed as an A-Level Computer Science project (2018-2019), and was intended for integration into work environments to enable employers to reduce the risks of **phishing attacks** (particularly emails) on their organisations.

The tool works by **simulating internal phishing emails** to employees and **monitoring responses**. A heuristic risk score is calculated for each employee based on their responses, and a **scheduler algorithm** operates alongside an emailer to intelligently automate the scheduling and sending of internal phishing emails.

The purpose of the tool is to improve the efficiency of cybersecurity training in workplaces by allowing employers to target training at higher risk employees.
