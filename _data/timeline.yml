- title: Student, University of Birmingham
  from: 2019
  to: present
  description: "I'm currently a first year student studying Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. My expectations
              of University were far exceeded in every possible aspect, and being plainly honest I don't think I could've had
              any better a first year than the one I've had. And, as the academic year comes to a close (albeit rather abruptly)
              I'm really looking forward to the years ahead; for the times I'll share with my friends, the experiences I
              hope to grow from and the studies that I anticipate will propel my career forwards in the future."
  final: "What do I want to do in the future? As of now, I'm not entirely sure. But here's to figuring it out!"
